Hi there! I'm Sathiya Seelan, currently working as an Associate Software Development Engineer-2 at Publicis Sapient. With a strong background in programming and web development, I specialize in crafting web experiences using various technologies.

My expertise spans across languages such as Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang, HTML, and CSS, alongside proficiency in popular frameworks like Node.js, Express, React, and Redux. Recently, I've delved into backend development with Spring Boot microservices, and database management using MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis. My experience extends to containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes and Helm, and managing cloud environments on GKE.

Additionally, I've honed my skills in continuous integration and deployment pipelines using Jenkins, and am adept at monitoring and alerting setups with Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing with Zipkin.

Passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly web applications, I thrive whether working independently or collaborating within a team. I'm committed to staying at the forefront of technology, continually expanding my knowledge base, and delivering high-quality solutions to meet the evolving needs of users and organizations.

Let's create something remarkable together!
